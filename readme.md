A SourceMod plugin for Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop.

Currently, it only persistently tracks player kills in a database.

SourceMod includes the necessary functionality to compile .sp files. 
Simply drag and drop the .sp onto the executable at sourcemod/scripting/spcomp.exe, or execute spcomp.exe targeting the file, ie `spcomp.exe example\file\path.sp`.
