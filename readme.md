A SourceMod plugin for Alien Swarm: Reactive Drop.

Currently, it only persistently tracks each player's kills in a database, and allows them to see their total kills.

SourceMod includes the necessary functionality to compile .sp files.
Simply drag and drop the .sp onto the executable at sourcemod/scripting/spcomp.exe, or execute spcomp.exe targeting the file, ie `spcomp.exe example\file\path.sp`.
This will produce a .smx file, which goes into your sourcemod plugins folder (in the case of AS:RD, a dedicated server installed via the Steam Library is in the same folder as the game): steamapps\common\Alien Swarm Reactive Drop\reactivedrop\addons\sourcemod\plugins
